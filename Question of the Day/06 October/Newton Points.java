Newton Points
Time Limit: 2 sec
Memory Limit: 128000 kB
Problem Statement
Newton initially has P points and he wants to play a game to earn more points. 
If he wins the game, he will gain 1 point but if he losses the game he will lose 1 point. He will play the game N number of times.

You want to find the points that Newton has after he has finished playing. Newton has given you a string of size N of o's and x's.
In which 'o' represents that newton won the game, 'x' represents that newton lost the game.

Find the points that Newton has after all the game are finished.

( Note: If after sometime Newton has 0 points and he loses another game, then no point will be deducted )
Input
The first line of the input consists of 2 integers, N and P.
The second line of the input consists of a string of length N.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 5x10^5
0 <= P <= 5x10^5
S is a string of length N consisting of o and x.
Output
Output the total points that Newton has in the end.
Example
Sample Input 1:
3 0
xox

Sample Output 1:
0


Sample Input 2:
20 199999
oooooooooxoooooooooo

Sample Output 2:
200017
